##  List Employees

URL: /api/employees/

### **Step 2: Prepare Authentication Demo**

#### 2.1 **Token Generation**:
- Using Postman or a command-line tool like `curl`, demonstrate getting a token:
  ```bash
  POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "testpassword"
  }
  ```
- This will return a token that looks like:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "your_generated_token_here"
  }
  ```

#### 2.2 **Use Token in Requests**:
- To access endpoints securely, add `Authorization: Token <your_token>` to each requestâ€™s header. In Postman, go to the Authorization tab, select "Token" as the type, and paste the token.
